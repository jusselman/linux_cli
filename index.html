            like files. You can read and write devices as though they were
            files. For example /dev/fd0 is the first floppy disk drive, /dev/sda
            (/dev/hda on older systems) is the first hard drive. All the devices
            that the kernel understands are represented here.

            virtual. The /proc direcotry contains little peep hoels into the
            kernel itself. There are a group of numbered entries in this
            directory that correspond to all the processes running on the
            system. Ademas, thre are quite a few named entries that permit
            access to the current configuration of the system. Many of these
            entries can viewed. Try viewing /proc/cpuinfo. This entry will tell

            TFinally, we come /media, a normal direcotry which is used in a
            special way. The /media direcotyr is used for
            <i>mount</i> points. As we learned in the second lesson, the
            different physical storage devices (like hard disk drives) are
            attached to the file system tree in various places. This process of
            attaching a device to the tree is called <i>mounting</i> For a
            device to be available, it must first be mounted.<Br /> When your
            system boots, it reads a list of mounting instructions in the file
            /etc/fstab, which describes which device is mounted at which mount
            point in the directory tree. This takes care of the hard drives, but
            you may also have devices that are considered temporary, such as
            CD-ROMs, thub drives, and floppy disk. Since These are removable
            devices, the /mnt direcotry provides a convenient place for mounting
            these temporary devices. You will often see the directories
            /mnt/floppy and /mnt/cdrom. To see what devices and mount points are
            used, type <u>mount</u>

        A Strange Kind of File
      </h2>
      <p class="example">
        A common strange kind of direcotry entry, particularly in the /boot and
        /lib directories. When listed with ls -l, you would have seen something
        like this:<br />
        lrwxrwxrwx 25 Jul 3 16:42 System.map -> /boot/System.map-2.0.36-3<br />
        -rw-r--r-- 105911 Oct 13 1998 System.map-2.0.36-0.7<br />
        -rw-r--r-- 11773 Oct 13 1998 module-info-2.0.36-0.7<br />
        lrwxrwxrwx 16 Dec 11 1999 vmlinuz -> vmlinuz-2.0.36-3<br />
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="example">
        Notice the files, System.map, module-info and vmlinuz. Notice strange
        notation after the file names<br />
        These three files are called sybolic links. Symbolic links are a special
        type of file that points to another file. With symbolic links, it is
        possible for a single file to have multiple names. Here's how it work:
        Whenever the system is given a file name that is a symbolic link, it
        transparently maps it to the files it is pointing to.<br />
        What good is this? This is a very useful feature. Consider the directory
        listing above (which is the /boot directory of an old Red Hat 5.2
        system). This system has had multiple versions of the Linux kernel
        installed. We can see this from the files vmlinuz-2.0.36-0.7 and
        vmlinuz-2.0.36-3. These files names suggest that bothe version
        2.0.36-0.7 and 2.0.36-0.7 and 2.0.36-3 are installed. Because the file
        names ccontain the version it is easy to see differences in the
        directory listing. However, this would be confusing to programs tath
        rely on a fixed name for the kernel file. These programs might expect
        the kernel to simply be called 'vmlinuz' that points to
        vmlinuz-2.0.36-3, we have solved the problem.<br />
        To make symbolic links, use the <u>ln</u> command.

        Power and flexibility m----f------s!! While it is easy to perform simple
        file manipulations witha graphical file manager, complicated tasks can
        be easier with the the commnad line programs. For exampole, how would
        you copy all the HTML files from one directory to another, but only copy
        files that did not exist in the destination directory or were newer than
        the versions in the destination directory? Pretty difficult with a file

        Before breaking down the commands, it's important to discuss the shell

        filenames so frequently, it provides special characters to help you
        rapidly specify groups of filenames. These special characters are called
        <i>wildcards</i>. Wildcards allow you to choose filenames based on
        patterns of characters. the table below lists the wildcards and what

        Linux has no means of undeleting whatever you should happen to delete. Once you delete with rm, it's basically

      <p class="warning-content">
        <b><i>Before you use rm with wildcards, try this helpful trick:</i></b> construct your command using ls instead. 
        By doing so, you can see the effect of your wildcards before you delte files. After you have tested your command with ls, recall the command with the up-arrow key and then supplant 'rm' for 'ls' in the command.

        Working with Commands
      </h2>

      <p class="definition">
        Unitl now there have been numerous commands and their peculiar options and argument etc. Here we will attempt to remove some of the mystique surrounding them. Let's look at the following: 
      </p>
      <ul class="ulist">
        <li class="ulist-item"><u>type</u> - Display info about command type</li>
        <li class="ulist-item">

        <li class="ulist-item"><u>help</u> - Display reference page for shell builtin</li>
        <li class="ulist-item"><u>man</u> - Display an on-line command reference</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="break-down-title">
        What are "Commands?"
      </h2>

      <p class="definition">
        Commands can be one of the four following kinds:<br>
        1. <b>An executable program</b> like all those file we saw in /usr/bin. Within this grouping/category, programs
        can be <i>compiled binaries</i> such as programs written in C and C++, or programs written in <i>scripting languages</i> such as the shell, Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.<br>
        2. <b>A commnad built into the shell itself.</b> Bash provides a number of commands internally called <i>shell builtins</i>. The <b>cd</b> command, for example, is a shell builtin.<br>
        3. <b>A shell function</b> These are miniature shell scripts incorporated into the <i>environment.</i> We will cover
        configuring the environment and writing shell functions in later lesson, but for now, just be aware that they exist.<br>
        4. <b>An alias</b> Commands that you can define yourselves, built from other commands. This will get covered later
      </p>

      <h2 class="break-down-title">
        Identifying Commands
      </h2>

      <p class="definition">
        It is frequently useful to know exactly which of the four kinds of commands is being used and Linux provides a couple of ways to find out.
      </p>

      <h2 class="break-down-header">
        type
      </h2>

      <p class="definition">
        The <b>type</b> command is a shell builtin that displays the kind of command the shell will execute, given a particular command name. It works like: <br>
        <i>type command</i><br>

      Where "command" is the name of the command you want to examine. Here are some examples: 
      </p>
  </div>


  <div class="cmd-line">
    <p>
      <span class="directory">
        [me@linuxbox me]$
      </span>
      type type<br>
      <span class="directory">
        type is a shell builtin<br><br>
      [me@linuxbox me]$</span>
       type ls<br>
       <span class="directory">
         ls is aliased to 'ls --color=tty'<br><br>
         [me@linuxbox me]$</span>
         type cp<br>
         <span class="directory">
          cp is /bin/cp
         </span>
      </p>
  </div>
  <hr>

  <div class="break-down">
    <p class="example">
     Thus are three results of three different commands. Take note that the one for <b>ls</b> (as taken from the Fedora System) and how the ls command is in reality an alias for the ls command with the "-- color=tty" option added. Now
     we get a picture as to why the output from <b>ls</b> is displayed in color.
    </p>

    <h2 class="break-down-header">
      which
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p class="example">
      At times there is more than one version of an executable program installed on the same system. It's not particularly
      common desktop systems, it's somewhat normal on the large servers. To get the exact location of a given executable, the 
      <b>which</b> command is used: 
    </p>
  </div>
  <br>

  <div class="cmd-line">
    <p>
      <span class="directory">

  </div>
  <br>

  <div class="break-down">
    <p class="definition">
      <b>which</b> only works for executable programs, not for builtins nor aliases that are subs for actual executable 
      programs.

        NAME

        cd - Change the shell working directory.
        <br>
        SYNOPSIS
        <br>
        cd [-L|-P] [dir] 
        <br>
        <br>
        DESCRIPTION
        <br>
        Change the shell working directory.
        <br>
        Change the current directory to DIR. The default DIR is the value of the HOME shell variable
        <br>
        The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing DIR. Alternative directory names CDPATH 
        are separated by a colon (:). A null directory name is the same as the current directory. If DIR begigns with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.
        <br>
        If the directory is not found, and the shell option 'cdable_vars' is set, the word is assumed to be a variable name.
        If that variable has a value, its value is used for DIR.
        <br>
        Options:
        <br>
        -L          force symbolic links to be followed
        <br>
        -P          use the physical directory structure without following symbolic links
        <br>

        The default is to follow symbolic links, as if '-L' were specified.
        <br>
        Exit Status
        <br>
        Returns 0 if the directory is changed; non-zero otherwise.

        man
      </h1>
      <br>
      <p class="definition">
        Most executable programs intended for the command line provide a formal piece of documentation called a manual or man page. A special paging program called <b>man</b> is used to view them. It is used like this:
        <br>
        <tt>man <i>program</i></tt>
        <br>
        where "program" is the name of the command to view. Man pages vary somewhat in format but generally conatin a title, a synopsis of the command's syntax, a description of the command's purpose, and a listing and description of each of the command's options. Man pages, however, do not usually include examples, and are intended as a reference, not a 
        tutorial. For an example, let's view the man page for the <b>ls</b> command:
        </p>
      </div>

    <div class="cmd-line">
      <p>
        <span class="directory">
          [me@linuxbox]$
        </span>
        man ls
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="break-down">
      <p class="definition">
        On most linux systems, <b>man</b> uses <b>less</b> to display the manual page, so all the familiar <b>less</b> commands work while displaying the page.
      </p>

        README and Other Documentation Files
      </h1>
      <br>
      <p class="definition">
        Many software packages installed on your system have documentation files residing in the /usr/share/doc directory. Most of thes eare stored in plain text format and can be viewed with <b>less.</b> Some of the files are in HTML format
        and can be viewed with your web browser. You may encounter some files ending with a ".gz" extension. this indicates that they have been compressed with the <b>gzip</b> compression program. The gzip package includes a special version of <b>less</b> called <b>zless</b> that will display the contents of gzip-compressed text files.
